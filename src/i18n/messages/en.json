    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about our baby AI video generator",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How does the Baby AI Video Generator work?",
      "answer": "Our baby AI video generator uses advanced deep learning models to analyze facial features in your video and transform them into baby-like appearances. The AI processes each frame individually while maintaining consistency, resulting in smooth, realistic baby transformations that preserve the original person's identity."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How long does it take to process a video?",
      "answer": "Processing time depends on video length and resolution. A 10-second 720p video typically takes 2-3 minutes. Our baby ai video generator uses optimized GPU processing for fast results. Longer videos or higher resolutions may take additional time, but we'll show you an estimate before processing."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What video formats are supported?",
      "answer": "We support MP4 and MOV files with H.264 or HEVC codecs, up to 300MB in size. Most videos from phones and cameras work perfectly with our AI baby face video generator. For best results, we recommend videos with clear, well-lit faces at 720p or higher resolution."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How much does it cost to use?",
      "answer": "We use a credit system: 1 credit per 4 seconds at 512p resolution. Higher resolutions use proportionally more credits. New users get 10 free credits to try our baby ai video generator. Credit packs start at $9.99 for 50 credits, with bulk discounts available."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Is my content private and secure?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Your videos are encrypted during upload and processing. We never use your content for training our models and automatically delete all files after 7 days. Our baby video AI tool is designed with privacy first - your content remains yours alone."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I use generated videos for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Yes, you retain all rights to your transformed videos and can use them commercially. The baby ai video generator creates content that belongs entirely to you. This makes it perfect for content creators, marketers, and businesses looking to create unique content."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "What makes your tool different from filters or apps?",
      "answer": "Unlike simple filters, our AI baby video maker performs complete facial reconstruction using advanced neural networks. We adjust facial proportions, features, and expressions to create authentic baby appearances while maintaining video quality and temporal consistency across all frames."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Do you support batch processing?",
      "answer": "Yes, premium users can process multiple videos simultaneously. Our baby face AI video generator can handle batch uploads, making it perfect for content creators and businesses who need to transform multiple videos efficiently."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the result?",
      "answer": "You can retry with different settings like strength and guidance parameters. If the issue persists, contact support for assistance or a credit refund. We want you to be completely satisfied with your baby-style videos and offer support to help you get the best results."
    },
    "q10": {
      "question": "Are there any content restrictions?",
      "answer": "Yes, we prohibit NSFW content, violence, and copyrighted material you don't own. Our baby ai video generator is designed for family-friendly content. We use automated content moderation to ensure all uploads comply with our guidelines."
    },
    "q11": {
      "question": "Can the AI handle multiple faces in one video?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our baby video generator AI can detect and transform multiple faces in a single video. Each face is processed individually with the same high quality, making it perfect for group videos, family content, or scenes with multiple people."
    },
    "q12": {
      "question": "How do I get support if I need help?",
      "answer": "We offer multiple support channels: email us at support@babyaivideo.com, use the live chat on our site, or check our comprehensive help center. Our support team typically responds within 24 hours and can help with technical issues, billing questions, or usage guidance."
